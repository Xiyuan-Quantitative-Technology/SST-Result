# A multitask approach to learn molecular quantum chemical properties



In order to run the code, python packages including (but not limited) deepchem, pytorch, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib should be installed. 

The program can generate the RRMSE for both ST and SST models with different base regressors, by simply running DNN_1L_SST_regress.py, DNN_2L_SST_regress.py, DNN_3L_SST_regress.py, XGBOOST_SST_regress.py, and GCN_SST_regress.py.
